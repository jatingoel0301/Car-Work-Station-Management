# Car-Work-Station-Management

This project tries to automate the working of a car service station and reduce manual labour. The car number is detected using `OCR` through Python Tessaract and auto-complaint is filed.

The core of the database programming is done using `triggers`, which are used to perform various checks in the database and lend consistency to it.

## Technologies Used

This project uses `MySQL` for database programming and `Python Tessaract` for Optical Character Recognition.

Here, we the crop the concerned portion of our image i.e the number plate of the car and use it as an input for the OCR. Please note that we need a clear image of the number of the car so it is better to focus only on the number of the car while taking the image aswell use a high quality camera.
